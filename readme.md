# Prototype Application with Angular Standalone Component and Skeleton Loading Functionality

I want to write a simple prototype application using an Angular standalone component with microfrontend and implement skeleton loading functionality for the component and its content.

Please suggest best practices for better user experiences and consider providing the best performance. Please do not use any third-party integrations. Feel free to implement a lazy loading feature, but give the user some indicator using a skeleton.

The purpose of these exercises is to implement a reusable microfrontend pattern to implement any standalone component for any project using angular.
